### Requirement 2:
#### Model Class:

Create a package in the src folder named: CoreJava.Models, in this package you will create every model class.

Every Model class must contain the following general two requirements:

First constructor takes no parameters and it initializes every members to an initial value.
Second constructor must initialize every private member with a parameter provided to the constructor.
Create a class Student with the private member variables specified in TABLE 1. These private members must have GETTERS and SETTERS methods.

The purpose of the Student class is to carry data related to one student.

### Requirement 3:
#### Data Access Objects

Under the package named: CoreJava.DAO, create a class and call it StudentDAO. This class is going to be used to search the csv files for student’s information only.

### Requirement 4:
#### Main Entry

Inside the package named: CoreJava.MainEntryPoint, there is a class named: MainRunner. When your code is complete, this class will be used to run the School Management System. None of the code in this class should be modified, and it should therefore only be used to test your code after you’ve finalized everything.

In the same package, there is also a class named TestRunner. Feel free to use this class to test your code as much as you’d like. Feel free to make changes. The content of the TestRunner class will not be factored into or used at all for your grade. Feel free to copy any of the code fromMainRunner into this class if you’d like to try making any modifications.

Sample: Students. Once a student is logged in, the student is able to see all the courses she/he is registered to. Two options are available 1. Register to Class and 2. Logout. If option 1 is selected, then the student is able to see all the courses and register to any of them.
